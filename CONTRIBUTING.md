# Contributing to MASI Bus

Thank you for your interest in the MASI Bus protocol! This is an open, community-driven standard for modular, safe, and efficient AI coordination.

## Ways to Contribute

1. **Implement a Module**  
   Build a Wisdom, Foresight, Empathy, Precision, or custom module that speaks the MASI Bus schema.  
   - Test it locally with the examples.  
   - Submit a benchmark result (see `benchmarks/TEMPLATE.md`).  
   - Open an Issue titled "Module Submission: [Your Module Name]" with a link to your repo/code.

2. **Propose Schema Extensions**  
   If you need new message_types, fields, or metrics:  
   - Open an Issue with rationale and example use case.  
   - Reference the original defensive publication for alignment.

3. **Submit Benchmarks**  
   Use `benchmarks/TEMPLATE.md` to report:  
   - Accuracy, bias drift, cost savings, energy efficiency, or Trust Score improvements.  
   - Empirical data preferred; simulations accepted with clear methodology.

4. **Improve Documentation or Examples**  
   Pull requests welcome for clearer READMEs, more examples, validation scripts, or translations.

5. **Future Public Registry / DAO**  
   Express interest in certification, governance, or Contributor Credits (MCC) via Issues tagged "registry".

## Guidelines

- All code/examples must be open source (any license compatible with CC0 core schema).
- Respect the defensive publication: no proprietary restrictions on the protocol itself.
- Be constructive — this is about cooperation, not competition.

We aim for interoperability like internet standards: anyone can build, everyone benefits.
