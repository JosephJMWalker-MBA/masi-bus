This repository contains the reference JSON Schema and example messages for the **MASI Bus**, the shared communication protocol described in the defensive publication:

> Walker, Joseph JM. "Coordinated, heterogeneous model composition under a shared governance and audit layer." Technical Disclosure Commons, Defensive Publications Series, Art. 9043 (December 15, 2025).  
> https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/9043

The MASI Bus enables Consult-Before-Execute (CBE) coordination between specialized modules (Wisdom, Foresight, Empathy, Precision, or custom roles) with full auditability, trust scoring, and interoperability.

## Quick Start

1. Validate any message against `schema/masi-bus-schema.json`
2. Use the examples in `examples/` as templates
3. Submit your own certified module to the future Public Registry (coming soon)

Researchers, independent developers, and companies are invited to:
- Implement modules
- Submit benchmarks
- Propose schema extensions (via Issues)

All contributions remain your property — this repo only defines the open protocol.

## File Structure

- `schema/masi-bus-schema.json` – Official JSON Schema (version 1.0)
- `examples/` – Five complete message examples covering a full CBE cycle
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – How to propose changes or submit modules

## Core Philosophy

Competition → Cooperation  
Secrecy → Transparency  
Scale race → Sustainable commons
